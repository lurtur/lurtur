# Hi there, I'm Luis RodriguezðŸ‘‹

## About Me ##
I'm a versatile software developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions across various domains.

My experience spans across:
- **C++**: Experienced in developing software for embedded devices (medical devices).
- **Python**: Experienced in automating tasks to improve efficiency.
- **Testing**: Hands on experience with Parasoft, GoogleTest.

Additionally I have got knowledge in web development by taking trainings on the following stack:
- **.Net and Angular**: Proficient in building dynamic and robust web applications.
- **Databases**: Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL.
Note: I do not have formal experience working on web projects. However my development skills for medical devices
can help me to handle web projects and I have proficiency to write code in C# thanks to self-learning mindset.

I hope to start growing in the web development industry as a freelancer.
